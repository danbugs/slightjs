# slightjs

> ðŸ””: SlightJS has been merged upstream onto [SpiderLightning/`slight`](https://github.com/deislabs/spiderlightning). For intructions on how to use it in `slight`, please see [this](https://github.com/deislabs/spiderlightning#js)

This is an experimental project to make it possible to write JavaScript guest applications that make use of SpiderLightning capabilities.

It is comprised of:
- an `engine/`, which pre-initializes Wasm and injects slight dependencies into the JS context (i.e., w/ `quickjs-wasm-rs`), and
- a `cli/`, which inits the pre-initialized Wasm w/ actual guest code by passing it to the engine through `stdin`.

To try it out yourself, you can do: 
```bash
make keyvalue-all-in-one
```

Here's a video demo:
